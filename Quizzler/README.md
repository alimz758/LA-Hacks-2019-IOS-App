This is a quiz app, that has 13 questions. Based on answerinf right pr wrong, the user would get points. This is the first

time that I implemeted MVC Design. I ,also, used PrgoressHUD, https://github.com/relatedcode/ProgressHUD.

You can simply change the questions from the QuestionBank class and add more/less questions.

Becarefull, you need to change the limit of the number of questions in ViewController.swift as I manually hard-coded it.
