# Second App Idea - Quizzler

This is a quiz app for educational purposes for kids, that has library of questions, images and their labels.

We implemented Google ML Kit to the labal the objects. 

We also implemented voice recognition, so if the user says the the word that matches with the label of the image,

the user gets point and the next image of the library would get loaded.

Parents can take a picture of different objects to add to the library of the images.

Since we used Google ML kit, https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/ios/label-images, we were not able to get a specific 

label, like a specific fruit. That implementation requires more advanced ML that non of us knew how to do that in 

the time-line of the hackathon
