# LA-Hacks-2019-IOS-App

## First-App-Idea
This is a personlized weather app, that the user can set a date, time, and location to get a weather notification 

and reminder to get the needed clothings for the weather, i.e an umbrella for a rainy day. 

Half way through the hackathon and coding we found out to use the push-notification feature 

we need to be registered on Apple Developer Account, so we stopped on working on this app and came-up with a new 

app idea in which you see it inside the this directory, LA-Hacks-2019; it is called Quizzler
